This program organizes files based on their extensions as defined in the provided dictionary named `SUBDIR`. 
Users are encouraged to modify the code as needed to suit their requirements. To customize the extensions, simply update or add entries to the `SUBDIR` dictionary.  
If you identify areas where the code can be improved, please feel free to fork the repository and implement the necessary changes.  
Please note that I am a beginner in programming and currently learning the basics. Thank you for your support and contributions!
